<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built an end-to-end forecasting consultant for the pharma industry, evolving it into a comprehensive intelligence platform. Initially, the focus was on core therapy analysis and patient funnel generation, requiring LLM integration. After initial deployment, the user provided critical feedback on UI state management and data quality/completeness for competitive intelligence, forecasting funnels, and scenario modeling. The AI adeptly addressed these, validating fixes through testing. Subsequently, the user requested an extensive list of advanced features. The AI structured these into strategic phases, completing Phase 1 (Multi-AI integration with Perplexity, Company Intelligence engine with Perplexity-based scraping, and Multi-Model AI Ensemble) and Phase 2 (Advanced Financial Modeling, Interactive Timeline Views, 2D Visualizations, and Custom Templates System). A key architectural shift occurred, moving from direct web scraping to exclusively using Perplexity API for compliance.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a computer application functioning as an end-to-end forecasting consultant for the pharmaceutical industry. The application must accept a therapy area and an optional product name.
Initial core functionalities:
1.  **Therapy Area Summary**: Summarize the disease/therapy area, including staging, biomarkers, treatment algorithms, and patient journey.
2.  **Patient Flow Funnel Generation**: Create a suitable patient flow funnel for forecasting, leveraging web search and LLMs.

Following the initial build, the user requested a comprehensive set of enhancements, leading to a multi-phase development:
*   **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Multi-AI Integration (Claude, Perplexity, optional Gemini), Company Intelligence Engine (100% Perplexity-based for compliance, scraping investor relations, press releases for competitive products, financial data), Enhanced Competitive Intelligence with real-time data, User Input Text Boxes for custom guidance, Real-time Market Monitoring (excluding stock price correlation, including timeline view for milestones), 2D Advanced Visualizations.
*   **Phase 2 (Completed)**: Advanced Financial Modeling (NPV/IRR, Monte Carlo), Interactive Timeline Views, 2D Advanced Visualizations (competitive positioning, sensitivity analysis), Custom Templates System (therapy-specific, regulatory, KOL).
*   **Pending Phases**: Predictive Intelligence & Market Access (Phase 3), Automation & Advanced Features (Phase 4).

Specific fixes requested by the user include:
*   Correcting button state management (only clicked button shows analyzing).
*   Improving Competitive Intelligence output (real data, no raw JSON, no see full analysis).
*   Implementing interactive patient flow funnel visualization.
*   Adding product context to scenario modeling.
*   Ensuring the Clinical Trials button is functional.

    -   **Changes Made**: Significant modifications were made iteratively.
        -   Initial setup for therapy area analysis and patient funnel generation.
        -   Integration of  for Claude API calls.
        -   Addition of  function and  endpoint for real-time web search and citation extraction.
        -   Implementation of  for product-to-company mapping and competitive/financial data extraction, now entirely powered by Perplexity.
        -   Development of  for multi-model AI validation (Claude, Perplexity, Gemini).
        -   Inclusion of advanced financial modeling functions (NPV, IRR, Monte Carlo, Sensitivity).
        -   Creation of timeline generation functions for milestones and competitive events.
        -   Integration of 2D advanced visualization data generation and custom template parsing.
        -   Extensive error handling and logging added across all new functions and endpoints.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: This is the main React component responsible for the entire user interface and user experience. It manages the application's state, handles user inputs (API keys, therapy area, product name), orchestrates API calls to the backend, and renders the various analysis results and visualizations.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file underwent substantial revisions to accommodate new features.
        -   Added state variables for managing multiple API keys (Claude, Perplexity, Gemini), loading states for individual buttons, and various analysis results.
        -   Implemented new input fields for Perplexity and Gemini API keys.
        -   Developed dynamic tab navigation to switch between Therapy Analysis, Competitive Intelligence, Company Intelligence, Multi-Model Ensemble, Financial Analysis, Timelines, and Templates.
        -   Integrated Plotly.js for rendering interactive charts for patient funnels, financial models, timelines, and competitive positioning.
        -   Implemented UI components for displaying detailed, structured results from each analysis type, including citations for Perplexity searches and confidence scores for ensemble analysis.
        -   Enhanced error handling to display user-friendly messages for API issues or processing failures.
        -   Updated the welcome message to reflect the expanded capabilities of the platform.

-    and :
    -   **Importance**: These files contain the Tailwind CSS styles that dictate the application's visual appearance, ensuring a professional, pharma-grade UI.
